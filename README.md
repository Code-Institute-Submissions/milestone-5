### Features left to implement
For the first release of this website I kept users having to go to checkout and entering card details for adding bugs. The reason is so that only people with serious bugs will actually bother posting (and any user wanting to add loads as a joke would be deterred), but I may rethink a better way to do this. You must be logged into an account to post a bug as it is, so maybe that is enough.


## Credits
