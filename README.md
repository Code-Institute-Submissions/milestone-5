# Subify Issue Tracker
This project is for Milestone 4 of Code Institutes Full Stack Development Diploma, and uses Python, Django and PostgreSQL in the backend and HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript in the frontend.
Subify Issue Tracker is a response to the growing popularity of Subify, the growing sandwich filling site. The developer decided a separate site was needed, dedicated to reporting and tracking bugs and a platform for users to ask for more features to be added to the main site.
[![This project uses Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jamesahorne/milestone-4.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamesahorne/milestone-4)


## Please note
I started the project with different project requirements and was advised by a Code Institute tutor to submit the project based on the older project requirements. For reference, the older project requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/jamesahorne/milestone_4/blob/master/project_requirements.md).

CHANGES MADE
About page - I decided to indent all headers except for h1s. In the mock up, no headers are indented
In the bug and feature forms, I removed the option for setting the status of a ticket, with the default set to ToDo, so that only an admin can change the ticket status.

## Technologies Used
Django Rest Framework - for rendering the chart.js data (?? is that right?)
Chart.js - for the data visualisation

### Features left to implement
Currently any user can edit any ticket. I will change this so that only the user who posted the ticket can edit the ticket.


## Credits
