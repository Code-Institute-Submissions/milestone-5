            <p>Subify. Your favourite sandwich filling site, on a mission to make sandwiches fun again!</p>
            <p>To expand the site, we've made an issue tracker site. Subify users can request bugs to be fixed and new features to enhance the user experience.</p>

        <div class="black-background">
            <p>Users can post bugs or tickets, and both bug requests and feature requests can be upvoted. Hopefully all requests will be implemented, but upvotes increase priority - the more upvotes a bug or feature request has, the sooner it will be fixed/added to the site.</p>
            <p>Bug tickets and upvotes are free, but feature tickets and upvotes are Â£10.</p>

        <div class="black-background">
            <p>A bug is an error that produces an incorrect or undesired result - something that prevents the site from working as intended.
            <br>A feature can be anything new and exciting that you think would improve the site; a better way of doing things, a new function on top of adding, editing and deleting recipes or a way to share recipes to social media or by messaging.</p>
            <p>It's also worth noting that you can only buy one feature ticket/upvote at a time, although there's no limit for how many feature tickets or feature upvotes you can buy.</p>
